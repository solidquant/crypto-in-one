# Crypto In One data streams

A work in process of data streams from multiple crypto exchanges.

### Plans for this repo:

- _Deribit_ options orderbook streams
- _OKX_ options orderbook streams
- _Bybit_ options orderbook streams
- _Binance_ options orderbook streams
- _Gate.io_ options orderbook streams
- _Delta Exchange_ options orderbook streams

1. First plan of action will be to integrate all crypto options data streams.

2. Next step would be to integrate DEX data streams. (Uniswap, Pancakeswap, Sushiswap, Synthetix, DyDx, Shell Protocol, etc.)

3. After the above steps, I will include Spot, Futures data streams.

The reason why I plan on integrating crypto options and DEX data first is because these sources are extremely hard to come by whereas spot, futures data sources are abundant.
